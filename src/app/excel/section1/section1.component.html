          Choosing a frontend framework for a new project has become a challenging task. There are so many factors that one must consider when putting together a technology stack. The problem seems to have increased lately with too many alternatives to choose from. Developers have debated for years about which framework is best for custom app development and why? The decision always leans towards the three dynamic frameworks - Angular, React.js, and Vue.js, but choosing between them is difficult.

          It is crucial for us to understand that there cannot be a perfect framework that fits all. The three frameworks we will talk about have their strengths and weaknesses and are popular for good reasons. Different projects need different features to function. Therefore, any of these frameworks can be used for any project based on the syntax and components required for the desired outcome.
